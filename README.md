# [WEB CV](http://alejandrofraga.me)
This is the project for my personal website in which I talk about my professional career

### TO-DO
* End cleaning and commenting all the HTML, CSS and Javascript code
* I want to make a new section that will correspond to a videogame in HTML*
* HTTPS instead of HTTP to avoid insecure connection

*In this section you'll can play as me in an interactive CV. So instead of reading boring details, you'll be reading boring details inside a videogame. Who doesn't love that?

### Sections

The website is divided in these sections:

  - [About](http://alejandrofraga.me/about.html) - Here I talk a little about my studies and experience
  - [Projects](http://alejandrofraga.me/index.html) - Here I show all my projects that are at least WIP

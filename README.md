# [WEB CV](http://alejandrofraga.me)
This is the project for my personal website in which I talk about my professional career

## Sections

The website is divided in these sections:

  - [About](http://alejandrofraga.me/about.html) - Here I talk a little about my studies and experience
  - [Projects](http://alejandrofraga.me/index.html) - Here I show all my projects that are at least WIP
  - IResume - Interactive resume* (WIP)

>*In this section you'll can play as me in an videogame. So instead of reading boring details, you'll be reading boring details inside a videogame. Who doesn't love that?
